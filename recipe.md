1)In a large bowl, add chicken pieces

2)Then, add all the ingredients from garlic paste to salt, mentioned below

3)Combine everything nicely

4)Cover and allow it to marinate for at least 2 hours under refrigeration

5)Add cornflour and mix well

6)Heat oil in deep pan or Kadhai (wok)

7)Once the heats up well, carefully slide-in the marinated chicken and fry them on medium high heat until done.

8)Take them out and drain onto an absorbent towel.

9)Sprinkle some chaat masala on fried chicken

10)Serve them with onions, lemon wedges on the side

Notes
1)Be sure to drain the water completely form the chicken before marinating it. We want the masala coat to be without any liquid, so drain every drop of water from it

2)Take out the marinated chicken from the refrigerator and allow it rest on the counter for few minutes before frying

3)DO NOT fry the chicken on low heat as this will make the coating soggy and oily
